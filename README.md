# The Hacking Project - Database of a Pinterest-like Website


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to design a **database** for a **Pinterest-like website** where :
* Users can create pins
* Each pin contains a URL of an image on the net
* Users can comment on pins, but cannot comment on comments.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_make-db-pinterest
$ bundle install
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.
